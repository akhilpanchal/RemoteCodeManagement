#1.
The run.bat starts 2 Clients and 2 Servers.
The ServerInfo.txt file contains a list of Server IP addresses and port numbers
The ServerInfo.txt file must contain the Servers' information that is started 
 entered in run.bat file to start servers.

#2.
The Client listens on a port passed to it on the CommandLine.
It makes sense to start it on a default port from command line instead of the 
user having to explicitly start the listener by giving the port number on the 
GUI everytime.

#3.
The GUI contains Instruction labels that might help the TA to understand how to
use the application to see if the requirements are satisfied.
